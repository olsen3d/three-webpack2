              Ingenuity is powered by a six lithium-ion battery 
              system that is recharged daily by a solar array 
              located atop its rotor system. Solar cells in the 
              array are optimized for the solar spectrum 
              encountered at Mars, and the stored energy is 
              used to operate heaters for the cold Martian 
              nights as well as power the helicopter during 
              flight operations. Power expended by the helicopter 
              during an up-to-90-second flight is about 350 watts.

              It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose injected humour and the like.
